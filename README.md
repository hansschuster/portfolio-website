# Portfolio Site Project

This repository contains the source code and all files necessary for
https://hansschuster.github.io/portfolio-website/. The site has been modelled
after the mockup in "design-mockup-portfolio.pdf", as part of Udacity's *Full
Stack Web Developer* Nanodegree.

The header and the portfolio grid have been implemented using CSS flex box,
with breakpoints at 640px and 1040px. Responsive images are realized with
attributes `srcset` and `sizes`.
